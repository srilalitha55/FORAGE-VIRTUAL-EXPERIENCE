JP Morgan Chase & Co - Agile Job Simulation

In this job simulation, I applied Agile practices to a real-world project scenario, working through various aspects of Scrum and Agile methodology to manage project workflows and improve team collaboration. Below are the key tasks I completed as part of this simulation : 

Drafted User Stories Using Trello and Prioritized by Effort Level

The first task involved drafting user stories for the development of a software product. I used Trello to organize and prioritize these user stories based on their relative effort levels. This included : 

Creating user stories that captured specific features and functionalities needed in the product.

Prioritizing user stories by estimating their complexity and effort, ensuring the team focused on the most important and feasible features first.

Applying Agile estimation techniques to ensure that the team’s capacity and timeline were effectively managed.

Conducted Scrum Team’s Daily Standups

I participated in facilitating the Scrum team’s daily standup, a key Scrum ceremony where team members discuss their progress and plan for the day. In this task, I:

Led the daily standup, encouraging open communication among team members to ensure alignment on priorities and tasks.

Ensured that all team members were on track with their work and understood the next steps, helping remove any blockers or obstacles in their way.

Focused on creating a collaborative and transparent environment to improve team performance and drive progress in short sprints.

Ran a Sprint Review and Retrospective

In this task, I organized two crucial Agile ceremonies:

Sprint Review: This ceremony allowed the team to showcase their work to stakeholders and gather feedback on the project’s progress. I facilitated the review to ensure stakeholders were involved in the decision-making process and the product met user needs.

Sprint Retrospective: I led a retrospective meeting, where the team discussed what went well, what could have been improved, and opportunities for process optimization. This allowed the team to reflect on the sprint and identify actions for improving future sprints.

Refined Agile Practices and Problem-Solving
Throughout the simulation, I applied Agile principles such as continuous improvement, iterative development, and flexibility. I also:

Identified areas for improvement in our Agile process and suggested solutions for overcoming common obstacles, such as miscommunication or task delays.

Adapted the workflow to ensure the team delivered high-quality products while maintaining a strong focus on customer value and collaboration.

This task helped me develop a strong understanding of Agile practices and Scrum ceremonies, while applying problem-solving techniques to improve project workflows and team collaboration. I honed my skills in managing iterative cycles, improving efficiency, and ensuring the project was aligned with Agile methodologies.
