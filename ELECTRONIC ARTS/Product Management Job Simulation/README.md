Electronic Arts - Product Management Job Simulation

In this job simulation, I developed a deep understanding of product management principles, focusing on selecting the most appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and measuring business outcomes in the context of the video game industry. I applied my knowledge to real-world product management challenges while also gaining insight into the importance of data-driven decision-making. 

Below are the tasks I completed as part of this simulation:

Developed an Understanding of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
In this task, I learned about the importance of KPIs in tracking and evaluating the success of a product. I gained knowledge on how to identify and define key metrics that are critical to assessing business performance, including:

Revenue per user

Customer acquisition costs

Player engagement metrics (e.g., active users, session length)

Retention rates (e.g., daily/monthly active users)

This helped me understand how KPIs are used to measure and align business goals with product development.

Selected Appropriate KPIs for a Strategy RPG Mobile Game

As part of the simulation, I selected the most relevant KPIs to assess the success of a strategy RPG mobile game. This involved:

Analyzing the specific business problems that the game aimed to solve, such as user engagement, monetization strategies, and long-term player retention.

Choosing KPIs that aligned with the gameâ€™s objectives, including metrics to evaluate user acquisition, player retention, and in-game purchases.

Understanding how these KPIs help the product team assess both the short-term and long-term success of the game, informing the next steps in development and 

marketing strategies.

Demonstrated Knowledge of KPIs in the Video Game Industry

I applied my knowledge to better understand how KPIs are used specifically in the video game industry. I explored:

The differences in KPIs across various game genres and platforms.

How the video game industry uses KPIs to track user experience, monetization, and player engagement.

How these KPIs influence product iterations, marketing campaigns, and user retention strategies.

This task deepened my understanding of how data-driven insights help game developers optimize gameplay experiences and profitability.

Created a Data-Driven Presentation for a Video Game Product

In the final task, I broke down the process of creating a data-driven presentation that outlines key business insights for a strategy RPG mobile game. I:

Analyzed how product data can be presented in a clear and actionable way for stakeholders, including the product team and senior leadership.

Focused on visualization and storytelling with data, ensuring the presentation included key metrics, performance trends, and strategic recommendations based on the 

selected KPIs.

This helped me develop my skills in data presentation, ensuring that insights were communicated effectively to stakeholders to drive informed decision-making.
